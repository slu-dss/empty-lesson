## Introduction


## Load Dependencies
The following code loads the package dependencies for our analysis from the `tidyverse`:

```{r package-load-1}
# tidyverse packages
library(dplyr)    # data wrangling
library(ggplot2)  # data plotting
library(readr)    # work with csv files
```

Now you try loading two additional packages - `here` (for working with file paths) and `skimr` (for generating descriptive statistics):

```{r package-load-2}

```

We now have the packages needed for our analyses.
